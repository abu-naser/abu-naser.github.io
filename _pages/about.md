I am a Ph.D. candidate at Department of Computer Science, Florida State University. My research interest in Parallel and Distributed Systems, High-Performance Computing(HPC), Cloud, and System Security with a specific focus on HPC security in the cluster and cloud environment. I am doing research under the supervision of [Dr. Zhi Wang](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~zwang/) and [Dr. Xin Yuan](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~xyuan/). I am grateful for having [Dr. Viet Tung Hoang](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~tvhoang/) as a committee member.

In my research project, I have designed and implemented a secure fast communication library (CryptMPI) for parallel computing architecture on top of MPICH and MVAPICH using the C programming language. In CryptMPI we have optimized both point-to-point and collective communication routines. We have used pre-computation, multi-threading, pipelining, and novel algorithms to optimize the performance of CryptMPI in many-core systems. All my works are publicly available on Github. At Argonne National Lab I have gained experience working with GPUs. I am working to identify reasons for GPU to GPU communication bottleneck in a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) library using benchmarking, profiling, debugging, and analyzing program critical paths. These works give me a solid foundation on Parallel and Distributed Systems for High-Performance Computing.

In addition to that, I have experience in working on system security projects. I have designed and implemented a memory vulnerabilities detection and prevention system. In another project, worked on an LLC cache side-channel defense project for HPC applications on a multi-tenant cloud environment. I also have 11 years of work experience including 1+ years of software development industry experience and am familiar with software development lifecycle (SDLC), and tools.
