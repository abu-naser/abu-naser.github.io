I am a Middleware Development Engineer at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) and working on [Intel-MPI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/mpi-library.html#gs.oigo4f) project.

Before that, I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science, at Florida State University. My research interest is in Parallel and Distributed Systems, High-Performance Computing(HPC), Cloud, and System Security.  I did research under the supervision of [Dr. Zhi Wang](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~zwang/) and [Dr. Xin Yuan](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~xyuan/). I am grateful for having [Dr. Viet Tung Hoang](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~tvhoang/) as a committee member.

In my Ph.D. research project, I have designed and implemented a secure, fast communication library (CryptMPI) for parallel computing architecture on top of MPICH and MVAPICH using the C programming language. In CryptMPI, I have optimized both point-to-point and collective communication routines. I used pre-computation, multi-threading, pipelining, and novel algorithms to optimize the performance of CryptMPI in many-core systems. All my works are publicly available on Github. At Argonne National Lab, I have gained experience working with GPUs. I worked to identify reasons for GPU to GPU communication bottleneck in a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) library using benchmarking, profiling, debugging, and analyzing program critical paths. These works give me a solid foundation in Parallel and Distributed Systems for High-Performance Computing.

In addition to that, I have experience working on system security projects. For example, I have designed and implemented a memory vulnerabilities detection and prevention system. In another project, worked on an LLC cache side-channel defense project for HPC applications on a multi-tenant cloud environment.
