I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Florida State University. My research interest in system and system security with a specific focus on HPC security in the cluster and cloud environment. I am doing research under the supervision of [Dr. Zhi Wang](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~zwang/) and [Dr. Xin Yuan](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~xyuan/). I am grateful for having [Dr. Viet Tung Hoang](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~tvhoang/) as a committee member.

In my current project, I am developing a secure fast communication library for parallel and distributed computing architecture.
