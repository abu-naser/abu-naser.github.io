I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Florida State University. My research interest in the system and system security with a specific focus on HPC security in the cluster and cloud environment. I am grateful for having Dr. Zhi Wang as major professor, Dr. Xin Yuan as co-advisor, and Dr. Viet Tung Hoang as committee member.

In my current project, I am developing a secure fast communication library for parallel and distributed computing architecture.
