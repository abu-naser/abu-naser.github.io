I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Florida State University. My research interest in the system and system security with a specific focus on HPC security in the cluster and cloud environment. I am grateful for having [Dr. Zhi Wang](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~zwang/) as major professor, [Dr. Xin Yuan](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~xyuan/) as co-advisor, and [Dr. Viet Tung Hoang](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~tvhoang/) as committee member.

In my current project, I am developing a secure fast communication library for parallel and distributed computing architecture.
